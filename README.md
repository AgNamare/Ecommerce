# Branch-Aware E-Commerce Platform

## Description

A scalable, full-stack e-commerce platform built with a focus on real-world retail operations.
The application supports multiple branches, dynamic product availability per location, advanced search and filtering, and flexible delivery options — including express delivery, scheduled delivery, and in-store pickup. 
Designed with both user experience and backend efficiency in mind.

## Why

This project was built to simulate the complexity of a real e-commerce system that supports physical branch logistics. 
Most tutorials and starter projects assume a single inventory source, but this application models true-to-life scenarios:
- Stock levels vary across multiple branches
- Customers can only purchase what’s available in their region
- Delivery method and time slot directly affect order processing
- Both guest and registered users can shop seamlessly

It serves both as a practical portfolio project and a foundation for building production-grade online retail systems.
